#Sentiment Analysis using Twitter data

`Sentiment and Subjectivity are mainly context and domain-dependent. Not only the
changes in vocabulary are the reason behind that but one more reason is the dual
meaning or sentiments of the same expression in different domains. Consider the
example of expression ‘go and read the book’. In the case of book reviews, this
expression gives the positive polarity about the product but in the case of a movie
review, the same expression gives negative polarity about the product. Sentiment
Analysis is more focused on the extraction of polarity about a particular topic rather
than assigning a particular emotion to the text.
Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis are the branches of Text Mining which refer
to the process of extracting nontrivial patterns and interesting information from
unstructured script documents. We can say that they are the addition to data mining`

`and knowledge discovery. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis focus on polarity
detection and emotion recognition correspondingly. Opinion Mining has more
marketable potential higher than data mining as it the most natural form of storing
the information in text format. It is a much complex task than data mining because it
has to deal with unstructured and fuzzy data. It is a multi-disciplinary area of
research because it constitutes the adoption of techniques in information retrieval,
text analysis and extraction, auto-categorization, machine learning, clustering, and
visualization.
Though Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining might look the same as the fields
like traditional text mining or fact-based analysis, it varies because of the following
facts. Sentiment Classification is the binary polarity classification which deals with a
relatively small number of classes. Sentiment classification is an easy task
compared to text auto-categorization. While Opinion mining exhibits many
additional tasks other than sentiment polarity detection like summarization and all.`
